## 📝 Reflection

**What I did:**  
- Built a static site with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Added interactivity beyond "Hello World" (validation, dark mode, local storage).  

**Level of success:**  
- Dark mode toggle works and persists across reloads.  
- Form validation prevents empty or invalid inputs.  
- Submissions save and display correctly.  

**What I learned:**  
- How to link CSS and JS into an HTML file.  
- How to use `localStorage` to persist data in the browser.  
- Basics of form validation and DOM manipulation.  

**Connection to my project outcome:**  
- Practicing client-side logic helps me prepare for a more advanced prototype (e.g., with a backend database).  
- This shows how I can handle user input and present it in a clean interface.  

**Team feedback:**  
- (Insert feedback here after sharing with your team, e.g., “They suggested I add a reset button for submissions.”)
